You decide to not be the hero and let the crook go
You hide in a dark alley as he runs in your direction
The crook ends up in the same alley as you and decides to take a quick break from running
You tense up as he removes his mask in order to catch his breath
All of a sudden he notices you standing there in the dark
The last thing you hear is him apologizing as he raises his gun and shoots you in the chest
You fall to the ground and look up at the sky as you bleed to death
Game over you lose!
