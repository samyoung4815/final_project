You decide to take the downtown back roads as you know them very well
You still see that the police are following you
You take a sharp left turn down an alley
You then hide behind some dumpsters as you watch the cop car fly by you
You slowly exit the alley in your car and make your way back home
Once you make it home you you dump the entire bag out on the table
You look in awe at all the jewels, gold, and money
Congratulations you win!!!
