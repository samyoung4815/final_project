You control your temptation and decide to leave the bag and wait for the police to arrive
When the police show up you wave them over to your location
They run over to you and instantly handcuff the crook laying on the ground
They congradulate your actions and tell you to get home safely
As you walk back to your car you reflect on yoru actions wishing you has atleast grabbed some of the money
Game over you took the easy way out
