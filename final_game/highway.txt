You decide that you will try to get away on the highway
You push your car to its limits as you weave in and out of traffic
As you drive you see the cop lights fade off further and further into the distance
Your smile quickley fades as a truck cuts you off and sends your car spinning into a ditch
Your car rolls over many times and finally lands upsidedown
You look down and realize a peice of metal from the car has lodged itself into your gut
As your thoughts start to slowly fade you rethink over all your stupid decisions
Maybe you should have been the hero instead GAME OVER!!!
